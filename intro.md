## Welcome to ENG 110

My name is Ms. Thompson, and I will be the instructor for ENG 110 this fall.

In all courses at The University of Akron, you will use a learning management system (LMS) called **Brightspace** to check your grades, submit assignments, and download readings.
This document is a short guide to walk you through completing most of these tasks. 

There are four areas you should familiarize yourself with over the next few weeks.  They are:

  1. Course Materials
  2. Assessments
  3. Communications
  4. Course selection tool
